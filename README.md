# BDSMTEVTOL-Aircraft
This repository contains the build, design, simulation, and test of an autonomous Electric Vertical Take-Off and Landing(EVTOL) vehicle from scratch.

# Observation, Nature, and Ornithology
The urge to look up and wonder "how?" creatures fly is so innate to homo sapiens that one misses the entirety of the beauty of flight during questioning. Quantum Mechanics states that the observer crashes the wave function to a simple wave. Schrodinger's not-so-funny portrayal of a cat in the box implied curiosity killed the cat. (Meow! Ouch!)

Will it be safe to ask: Can one even observe flight just as it is? No image, no projections, literally nothing, just observe, observe, observe, and voila! Your entire consciousness is filled with what lies(interesting word choice) ahead of you. You lose the sense of time, space, relationship with your loved ones, hunger, and the most important thing in the world i.e. "YOU". Do you know that you may reach a state where "you are the world and the world is you!"? Can one even ponder this? Has anyone ever observed this in oneself? 

If yes, then maybe that was the whole reason why humans started studying nature and assigned the word "Ornithology". Some wise homosapien once said, "Words create Reality." So be it!
